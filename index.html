      <div class="summary">
        My name is Sachit Dural. I am a 30-year-old man from Babesa, Thimphu,
        Bhutan. I am a curious and intelligent individual who is always looking
        for new challenges. I am also a smart hard worker and am always willing
        to put in the effort to achieve my goals. I was born on June 10th, 1993
        to a loving family. I attended Motithang Higher Secondary School for my
        High School and Royal Thimphu College for my Bachelors degree in English
        and Environmental Studies. After graduating from college, I worked as a
        Team Manager and Sr. Team Manager in ScanCafe for 4 years. Then decided
        to develop myself in being able to manage projects which are IT related
        and worked with Bhutan Clouds Enterprise for 2 Years. With knowledge
        from thoses two organizations I embarked on a journey of working with AI
        and ML and worked with iMerit Bhutan Pvt. Ltd. as a Lead - L&D Specalist
        Learning and Development. Now I am on my journey to pursue my Masters in
        Project Management as I am interested in managing Projects that are
        purely related to AI and ML modle development. I am passionate about
        learning new things and growing personally. I enjoy reading, research,
        playing guitar and piano, and learning programming (Which has as been my
        all time goal since the IT Revolution has boomed). I am also interested
        in learning new things and growing personally as a leader as I am a well
        versed people’s manager and have keen interest in working with a variety
        of people. I believe that it is important to be well-rounded and to have
        a variety of interests. One of my goals is to become a successful
        project manager. I believe that my skills and experience would make me a
        valuable asset to any team. I am confident that I will be able to
        achieve my goal and that I will make a difference in the world. I am
        excited to see what the future holds. I am confident that I will be able
        to achieve my goals and make a difference in the world.
